PHASE 3 EDA REPORT
================================================================================

Top Features by Importance:
           Feature  MI_Score
10        ST_Slope  0.204171
8   ExerciseAngina  0.135266
2    ChestPainType  0.126065
9          Oldpeak  0.093727
7            MaxHR  0.074047

Key Findings:
1. ST_Slope is the strongest predictor
2. Multiple features show significant correlation
3. Outliers are within expected ranges
4. Data is ready for preprocessing

Recommendations:
- Use top 5 features as priority
- Encode categorical variables in Phase 4
- Handle zeros in RestingBP and Cholesterol
- Consider feature scaling for distance-based models

Next: Phase 4 - Data Preprocessing
