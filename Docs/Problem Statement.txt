Problem Statement

Heart failure is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. 
Early prediction and intervention can save lives and reduce healthcare costs. 
However, healthcare professionals often struggle to accurately identify individuals at high risk of heart failure based on clinical data alone.
This project aims to build a robust data-driven model using patient health records to predict the likelihood of heart failure. 
By leveraging open-source medical datasets, 
the project seeks to empower clinicians and healthcare stakeholders with actionable insights for timely intervention, 
improved patient outcomes, and more efficient allocation of healthcare resources.
