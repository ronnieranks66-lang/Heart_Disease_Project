# PHASE 3: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)
## Heart Disease Prediction System

---

## Overview
- **Duration:** 3 days (8 hours)
- **Objective:** Discover patterns and relationships
- **Status:** ✓ COMPLETE

---

## What You'll Do

### 1. Correlation Analysis
```python
import seaborn as sns
correlation_matrix = df.corr()
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix)
```

### 2. Feature-Target Relationships
- Calculate correlation with target
- Top 5 most correlated features:
  1. ST_Slope: 0.38
  2. ExerciseAngina: 0.32
  3. Oldpeak: 0.30
  4. Age: 0.25
  5. MaxHR: -0.24

### 3. Numerical Features Analysis
- Distribution plots for each feature
- Box plots for outlier detection
- Compare disease vs healthy

### 4. Categorical Features Analysis
- Value counts for each category
- Chi-square tests with target
- Visualize proportions

### 5. Statistical Testing
- Correlation significance
- T-tests for groups
- Chi-square for categories

---

## Key Findings
✓ ST_Slope strongest predictor (0.38)
✓ ExerciseAngina highly associated
✓ Age shows linear relationship
✓ MaxHR negative correlation
✓ ~50 medically valid outliers
✓ Features show clear patterns

---

## Deliverables
✓ Correlation heatmap
✓ Feature-target analysis
✓ Distribution visualizations
✓ Outlier detection plot
