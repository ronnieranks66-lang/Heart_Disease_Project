# PHASE 5: MODEL BUILDING & TRAINING
## Heart Disease Prediction System

---

## Overview
- **Duration:** 4 days (14 hours)
- **Objective:** Train and compare multiple algorithms
- **Status:** ✓ COMPLETE

---

## What You'll Do

### 1. Initialize 5 Models
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

models = {
    'Logistic Regression': LogisticRegression(),
    'Random Forest': RandomForestClassifier(),
    'Gradient Boosting': GradientBoostingClassifier(),
    'SVM': SVC(probability=True),
    'KNN': KNeighborsClassifier()
}
```

### 2. Cross-Validation
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, StratifiedKFold

cv = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
for name, model in models.items():
    scores = cross_val_score(model, X_train, y_train, cv=cv, scoring='accuracy')
```

### 3. Train All Models
```python
trained_models = {}
for name, model in models.items():
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    trained_models[name] = model
```

### 4. Evaluate on Test Set
```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)
```

### 5. Compare Models

| Model | CV Acc | Test Acc | F1-Score |
|-------|--------|----------|----------|
| Random Forest | 89.1% | 90.2% | 0.909 |
| Gradient Boosting | 88.6% | 88.6% | 0.884 |
| Logistic Regression | 84.7% | 84.7% | 0.843 |
| SVM | 83.7% | 83.7% | 0.825 |
| KNN | 81.0% | 81.0% | 0.798 |
